        <div><p>I love drawing in my free time and above I have shown some drawings. I like drawing because we can use different strokes for every drawing a new colour of every corner and give it a creative finishing at the last , drawing can be realastic , creative , hyper-realastic , sketch etc....... and paintings are also done in many mediums like oil painting medium which is the easiest and water colour medium which is the hardest and then acrylic painting medium that can be easy or hard no matter what's the medium every stroke and medium has it's own finishing , own creativity , own topic and own style........................ </p></div>
